# COMP6210-Assessment2

## Description
This is a React based web app running on node with the help of Google Firebase to handle the backend. The data recycled from the first assessment for 6210, with additional entries being generated with the help of ChatGPT.

In addition to the linked project board, issues were created and closed in this repository as I worked through the project. Additional evidence of my efforts can be seen in the commit history of this repository.

It should be noted that I wasn't quite able to get this project working up to what the assessment outlined. As I mentioned in the retrospectives on the Kanban board, I was having some problems getting Firebase to cooperate to the level that it should. But I've now got a pretty good sense for how quickly a react app can rack up 50,000 reads.
